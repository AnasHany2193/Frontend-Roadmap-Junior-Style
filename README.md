# Front-End Developer Roadmap

This is a personal roadmap I created to guide anyone who wants to start learning front-end development from scratch. It's based on my own learning journey, and includes free resources, tips, and a few side notes to make things easier.

It's written in a simple and casual style, just like how I'd explain it to a friend.

## Final Note

This roadmap is not a final reference or an official learning path.  
It's just a personal effort by a student who’s been learning and wanted to share the experience in a simple and honest way.  
If it helps even one person out there, then it did its job.
